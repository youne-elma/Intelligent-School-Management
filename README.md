# ProjetPFE : University Website Azrou

This project is made with Django/Python/MySql for the backend and Html/TailwindCss/Javascript for the front part.

This is a complete university website, fully optimized for _desktop_ and _mobile_, with a great design made by us in Figma [UniWebsite](https://www.figma.com/file/8RMm1GXdD7kvVzV39RZ5JV/University-Website?type=design&node-id=24%3A3&t=qC1wteOGqSloVIm4-1)

**Documentation Sources** : 
- Django Docs (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/).
- Tailwind Docs (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).
- We utilized YouTube as a valuable resource for documentation and tutorial videos (https://youtube.com/)
- we heavily relied on Stack Overflow as an invaluable resource for documentation and problem-solving. (https://stackoverflow.com)
